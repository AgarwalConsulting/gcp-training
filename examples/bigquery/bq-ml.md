# BigQuery ML for [Binary Logistic Regression](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery-ml/docs/bigqueryml-web-ui-start)

Create a model that predicts whether a website visitor will make a transaction.

## Steps

1. Create a dataset with name: `bqml_tutorial`

2. Create your model

```sql
-- # standardSQL
CREATE MODEL `bqml_tutorial.sample_model`
OPTIONS(model_type='logistic_reg') AS
SELECT
  IF(totals.transactions IS NULL, 0, 1) AS label,
  IFNULL(device.operatingSystem, "") AS os,
  device.isMobile AS is_mobile,
  IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country,
  IFNULL(totals.pageviews, 0) AS pageviews
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
WHERE
  _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170630'
```

3. Evaluate your model

```sql
-- # standardSQL
SELECT
  *
FROM
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL `bqml_tutorial.sample_model`, (
SELECT
  IF(totals.transactions IS NULL, 0, 1) AS label,
  IFNULL(device.operatingSystem, "") AS os,
  device.isMobile AS is_mobile,
  IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country,
  IFNULL(totals.pageviews, 0) AS pageviews
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
WHERE
  _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20170701' AND '20170801'))
```

4. Use your model to predict outcomes

```sql
-- # standardSQL
SELECT
  country,
  SUM(predicted_label) as total_predicted_purchases
FROM
  ML.PREDICT(MODEL `bqml_tutorial.sample_model`, (
SELECT
  IFNULL(device.operatingSystem, "") AS os,
  device.isMobile AS is_mobile,
  IFNULL(totals.pageviews, 0) AS pageviews,
  IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
WHERE
  _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20170701' AND '20170801'))
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY total_predicted_purchases DESC
LIMIT 10
```

5. Predict purchases per user

```sql
-- # standardSQL
SELECT
  fullVisitorId,
  SUM(predicted_label) as total_predicted_purchases
FROM
  ML.PREDICT(MODEL `bqml_tutorial.sample_model`, (
SELECT
  IFNULL(device.operatingSystem, "") AS os,
  device.isMobile AS is_mobile,
  IFNULL(totals.pageviews, 0) AS pageviews,
  IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country,
  fullVisitorId
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
WHERE
  _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20170701' AND '20170801'))
GROUP BY fullVisitorId
ORDER BY total_predicted_purchases DESC
LIMIT 10
```
