# Setup

## Local VM setup

We are going to be using the latest tools like `gCloud SDK` & `terraform`, within a vagrant box (You can also do this locally.)

To bring the box up:

```bash
vagrant up
```

## Working with gcloud locally

### Step 1

Initialize gcloud with your account & project details:

```bash
gcloud init
```

### Step 2

Create a service account with credentials file
